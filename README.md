1. After installation, you will be redirected to the login page.

2. Once you confirm the activation you should be able to generate tests right away.

3. Open existing Python file or write a new Python class/function and press the "Generate Tests" on top of the class/function.

4. A new tab will open in your PyCharm with the generated tests, along with your code analysis, test plan, and test code.

5. Modify the test style in the Optional Instructions dropdown and re-generate tests in the new style.

6. Modify the test cases list to fully control generated tests. Exclude the cases you don't need, include suggested cases from the "Additional Test Cases" list, and add your own test cases. After each edit re-generate tests to get a new list of test code.

7. Save tests you find useful to a new file.
